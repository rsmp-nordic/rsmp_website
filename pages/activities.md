## Meeting Summaries

## User Group
The RSMP Nordic User Group in a network for sharing knowledge about RSMP and its practical use. The user group also provide input to the technical working group.

If you're wondering whether RSMP might be a good fit for your city, need input on how to require RSMP in tenders or want to share experiences about RSMP solutions, we recommend you join upcoming User Group meetings. You're also welcome to suggest topics for upcoming meetings.

Some meetings are only for road authorities, while others are open to anyone interested.

## Working Groups
The RSMP Nordic Working Groups discuss technical issues and produce proposals for review by the Board. The working groups are where we shape the next versions of the RSMP specifications.

Anyone interested can join the RSMP [Working Groups]({% link pages/groups.md %}), but only RSMP Nordic partners can be listed as co-authors of proposals.

## Coordination
RSMP Nordic coordination, strategy, resource planning and administration is handled by the following groups.

### Secretariat
The secretariat provides administrative and logistical support and helps organize meetings. The secretariat is also the entry point for [general queries]({% link pages/contact.md %}).

### Technical Board
The RSMP Nordic Board is responsible for technical coordination and decisions and maintains the RSMP roadmap. The board reviews technical proposals from the working group and decides which proposals are accepted.

The board has representatives from public road authorities only and is appointed by the Steering Group.

### Steering Group
The steering group is responsible for overall coordination and strategic decisions and has representatives from public road authorities only.

Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland each have permanent seats in the steering group, but can invite other RSMP Nordic road authority partners to fill remaining seats.

Road authorities that have a special interest in the future and strategic development of RSMP might want to join the Steering Group. Please [contact]({% link pages/contact.md %}) us for more information.
