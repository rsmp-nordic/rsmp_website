# Compliance

## Tools
RSMP Nordic offers [open source tools]({% link pages/documentation.md %}) that can be used to check and document compliance to the RSMP specification. These tools can be used by suppliers, road authorities or anyone else that would like to validate or experience with equipment or supervisor systems.

## Test Hub
RMSP Nordic hosts a RSMP Test Hub, where we automatically run the RSMP Validator tests daily against a set of equipment from various suppliers. The results are published here.

Note: Until the [RMSP Validator](https://github.com/rsmp-nordic/rsmp_validator) reaches version 1.0, test results are preliminary.

If you're a supplier with equipment that you would like included in our Test Hub, please contact the [RSMP Nordic secretariat]({% link pages/documentation.md %}).
