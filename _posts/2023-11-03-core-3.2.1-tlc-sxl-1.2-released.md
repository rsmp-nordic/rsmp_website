The RSMP core specification 3.2.1 and Signal Exchange List 1.2 (SXL) for Traffic Light Controller has been released.

## RSMP 3.2.1
RSMP 3.2.1 can be [viewed online](https://rsmp-nordic.github.io/rsmp_specifications/core/3.2.1/)
and is [available as PDF](https://github.com/rsmp-nordic/rsmp_core/releases/download/v3.2.1/rsmp-spec-3.2.1.pdf).

RSMP 3.2.1 is a minor update from RSMP 3.2 which was released last year.

The version history is [included in the specification](https://rsmp-nordic.github.io/rsmp_specifications/core/3.2.1/changelog.html),
but the important changes are:

- Add timestamp as a data type. A time stamp uses W3C XML dateTime definition.
  This means that there is no need to define this separately in the signal exchange list (SXL).
- The data type number is added and long and real data types are removed.
  They are removed since they don’t exist in the ECMA standard
  (JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA). “number” is used instead.
- Add a separate section about error handling
- Include the full change log
