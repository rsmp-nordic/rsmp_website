# Working Groups
The RSMP Nordic Working Groups discuss specific topics and produce proposals for review by the Board. The working groups are where we shape the next versions of the RSMP specifications.

Most working groups focus on technical issues, like developing the RSMP specification and tools, but workings groups can also handle things like communication, outreach or funding.

The working groups reflect the latest [Activity Plan]({% link pages/activity_plan_2025_26.md %}) agreed by the Steering Group, and can also be created ad-hoc by the Board as needed.

Meeting summaries can be found at our main RSMP [discussion area](https://github.com/orgs/rsmp-nordic/discussions/categories/working-groups).

Anyone interested can join the RSMP working groups, but only RSMP Nordic partners can be listed as co-authors of proposals. Please contact the [secretariat]({% link pages/contact.md %}) for more info.

Working group meetings happend every second week, on odd week numbers:

|            | Tuesday       | Thursday                      |
|------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
|  9-101AM   | Core          | SXL Traffic Light Controllers |
| 10-11AM    | Security      | Traffic Light Programming     |
| 11-12AM    | _break_       | _break_                       |
| 12AM - 1PM | RSMP 4        | SXL Standardization           |
| 1PM -  2PM | Tools         |                               |

Meetings are run via Microsoft Teams. To be receive meeting invitations, please contact the [secretariat]({% link pages/contact.md %}).

## Core
Maintain and develop the core RSMP specification which defines the basic message structure and behavior that is common for all types of equipment.

#### Timeline
Continously, with a yearly release around October.


## Security
Discusion and security, including encryption and certificate handling in RSMP.
Coordinate with the Core WG.

#### Timeline
Continously.


## RSMP 4
Research the opportunities of a core version 4.0, as well the resources and risk that would be involved.

Version 4.0 would include larger changes that solve some of the limitations of the existing specification but might not be backwards compatible.

Questions to be answered include:

-	Opportunities and benefits?
-	Resources required?
-	Risks involved?

The goal is to answer these questions and provide a recommendation on whether and when to move ahead with Core 4.0 or focus on more conservative releases of the 3.x series.

#### Timeline
Decision on v4 in 2025 (tentative).

## Tools
Maintain and develop tools for RSMP testing, validation, etc.

#### Timeline
Continously. Usuallt release of Core and SXL specifications are supported by released of the testing tools.

## Traffic Light Controllers
Maintain and develop the SXL (Signal Exchange List) for Traffic Light Controllers.

#### Timeline
Continously, with a yearly release around October.


## Traffic Light Programming
Using RSMP to make it easier for program traffic light controllers. Includes creating an intial open specification for TLC programs, to enhance interoperable workflows.

#### Timeline
Q3 2024 - Q3 2025.  


## SXL Standardization
Standardize and publish SXLs for other types of equipment.

RSMP can be used for many different types of equipment, and this is indeed already the case in many cities. However, only the SXL for Traffic Light Controllers have been standardized by RSMP Nordic all other uses of RSMP for other types of equipment rely on custom SXLs. This means every project reinvent the same type of messages, and that equipment and systems using these custom SXLs are incompatible.

The initial proposed list of equipment types to support include, Variable Message Signs, Traffic Counters and I/O devices.

#### Timeline
Release of SXL for other types of equipment (beyond TLCs) in Q3 2025 (tentative).
