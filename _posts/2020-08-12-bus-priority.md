Using RSMP it has never been easier for road authorities to manage and optimize bus priority.

Intersections that includes detection and priority of busses can enhance bus operation. This can help increase passenger satisfaction.

Flexible bus priority is one of many possibilities that RSMP enables. RSMP offers are a catalogue of messages useful for prioritizing busses and other types of vehicles.

The City of Copenhagen is currently working on implementing RSMP for a stable bus priority system than communications in real-time with the bus operator data systems, and works across products and systems.
