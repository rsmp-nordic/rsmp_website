# RSMP - Roadside Message Protocol
Effective and intelligent handling of traffic is a priority to the cities, municipalities and state bodies on the Nordic region.

This is an addtion.

To achieve this goal, the protocols used to monitor and control traffic signal, variable message signs and other road side equipment are central. OK standards cause vendor lock-in and fragmented infrastructure, while open standard can reduce maintenance costs, increase interoperability and support innovation.


# The RSMP Nordic Partnership
RSMP is maintained and developed by RSMP Nordic, a partnership of road authorities in the Nordic region.

Our missing is to help Nordic oad authorities reach their goals related to environment, traffic and quality of life, by making RSMP a widely used, flexible and innovative protocol for communication  between all types of road side equipment and traffic management systems in the Nordic region.

RSMP Nordic maintains the RSMP specification and related open-source tools for RSMP development and validation.

RSMP Nordic also facilitates user groups and knowledge sharing.

# Supporting EU-standardisation
The EU is working on several ITS standards, e.g. in the CEN TC278/WG17 working group. RSMP Nordic supports this work and welcome European standards, as long as they are of high quality and meet the needs of the Nordic region.

European standards will take time to develop and the current approach is to builde  on regional standards to provide a graceful transition into new EU-standards. We maintain RSMP as a regional standard that can be interfaced or replaced with European standards once they are ready. Now and in the future RSMP Nordic will provide a constructive Nordic voice in the ongoing EU standardisation process.
